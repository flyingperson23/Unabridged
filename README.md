### What's This?
This repository serves as a config repository and issue tracker for my modpack, Unabridged V: Remastered. This is a rework of Unabridged V for 1.12, with some custom recipes and the like added. Please submit all issues here. Keep in mind that this is quite a large pack. I will try my best to ensure that your computer can run it, but if you happen to own a literal potato, please do not submit issues such as "IT WONT LOAD AND IT HAZ THE SPINNY ERRORY THINGY" or "HOW DOES I TURN IT ON I PLUGGED THE POWER CORD IN BUT IT DIDN'T DO ANYTHING IT'S STILL A POTATO ON MY DESK HELP I CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT WITH MY SINGLE BRAIN CELLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!!!!!!"

The definition of the word "Unabridged" is: not cut or shortened; complete
 
In this pack you will find something for everyone. Whether you be a magician, machinist, explorer, or architect, there is always something new to discover!
 
One of the main goals of the pack is to make sure there is considerable diversity in the mods available, catering to many different styles of play. I usually prefer to spotlight and promote unique mods that are not what everyone normally uses, while still offering a majority of the "basics". There will be no forced progression through any mod. The choice is yours to make on how challenging or simple your adventure will be.
